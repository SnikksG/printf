The project, _printf is the first major project that is built in the alx school, is about building a function as similar as possible to the original function present in the standard library of programming language C, this is a challenge of some difficulty since the original function behaves in very specific ways in certain cases.

This project was built by Nicole Gondo and Nothando Ndebele
